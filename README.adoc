== Process

=== Introduction

The release process is divided in two categories.
The first part that we mention by using the term the *release*, is when we create a new java code release. It relies on the Maven Release Plugin to perform the release. It involves signing with a GPG key and a code signing certificate. At the end of this operation signed maven artifacts are pushed to a Maven repository.

The second part that we name *packaging* is when we retrieve from a Maven repository, the version we want to package. Then we build distribution packages, publish them, promote artifacts between staging and production environment if needed and finally we ensure that our mirrors are up to date.

==== Required
In order to trigger a new release, you must fulfil following requirements:

- [x] https://github.com/jenkins-infra/openvpn[Jenkins VPN Access] access
- [x] Being part of LDAP group 'release-core'
- [x] https://release.ci.jenkins.io[release.ci.jenkins.io] access

=== Release
At this stage, we are going to retrieve the Java code, release a new version using the maven release plugin and then publish artifacts on a maven repository.

It's important to notice that we do not use the maven release plugin to checkout git repositories neither to push changes. This allow us to release from a different git repository than the one defined in the pom.xml. We also need to be able to push commits to a different repository than the one defined in the pom.xml.

. link:http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/perform-mojo.html#localCheckout[localCheckout] must be set to true
. link:http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/prepare-mojo.html#pushChanges[pushChanges] must be set to false


==== Steps

Estimated time +- 1h30

. Connect to the Jenkins VPN.
. Open your favorite browser to https://release.ci.jenkins.io.
. Trigger the release job on the master branch. https://release.ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/core%2Frelease/branches/[Link].
. Once triggered, it asks you which release line you want to do. It's important to know that the release line matches one of the profiles file defined https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/tree/master/profile.d[here], so please carefully review the settings and be sure that it does what you are looking for.
. At the end of the job, git commits and maven artifacts will be pushed to their respective locations.

==== Validate
To validate that the release went well, excepted by having a green build, you can double-check that your artifacts have been correctly pushed to Maven repository located on `$MAVEN_REPOSITORY_URL/$MAVEN_REPOSITORY_NAME/org/jenkins-ci/main/jenkins-war/`. You could also run `jarsigner -verify <your generated artifact>` is correct.

==== Stage
In order to have private maven releases, you can modify `RELEASE_GIT_REPOSITORY` or `MAVEN_REPOSITORY_NAME`, to respectively use code from a private git repository and then push artifacts to a private maven repository.

Artifact promotion is done in the next stage 'packaging'.

=== Packaging

The packaging process looks after the latest Jenkins version published on a Maven repository and then build and publish artifacts for Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Windows. It also republishes the War file on the package server.
If enabled, then it promotes git commits between git repository, promotes maven artifacts between maven repository.

NOTE: Packages are not re-published if they already exist, only package website is overridden so it's safe to re-trigger the job.


==== Steps

Estimated time +- 30min

. Connect to the Jenkins VPN
. Open your favorite browser to https://release.ci.jenkins.io[release.ci.jenkins.io]
. Trigger the packaging job on the master branch. https://release.ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/core%2Fpackage/branches/[Link]
. Once triggered, it asks you which release line you want to package for. The release line matches one of the profile defines in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/tree/master/profile.d[profile.d], so please carefully review those settings in order to validate that's what you are looking for.

Once the job is done, every package will be published and then mirror synchronized.

==== Validate
Ensure that packages are correctly published on pkg.jenkins.io and correctly signed.

==== Stage
Staging packages is not yet fully supported, more information on link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-1363[INFRA-1363] and link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-2608[INFRA-2608]

== Profile
The release profile is used to identify the kind of release we are going to do. They are mainly influenced by following elements:

. Do we want to releases based on different repository branch?
. Do we want to release based on different git repository?

At the moment we identify three release types:

. Weekly
. Stable
. Security (both weekly and LTS)

[NOTE]
====
link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io[release.ci.jenkins.io] has two generic jobs, one for release and a second one for packaging.
One job per release type triggers the two generic jobs with different parameters.
While it isn't required to trigger a release type job, it increases visibility and reduces the risk of human error.
====

=== Weekly

The weekly release is the default release. It is scheduled every Tuesday as defined by this link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/19685def608c641496e6e2de3d40c275ca5e913d/Jenkinsfile.d/core/weekly#L15[cron].
It uses parameters defined in this link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/weekly[file]

It releases using the repository https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[jenkinsci/jenkins] from the branch master. Artifacts are pushed to the default maven repository 'Releases'.

If for some reason the release job needs to be re-triggered, you can:

. Connect to the Jenkins VPN
. Open your favorite browser to link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io[release.ci.jenkins.io]
. Review the weekly environment https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/weekly[file]:
. Trigger the weekly link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/core%2Fweekly%2Frelease/branches/[job]

[NOTE]
====
You can re-trigger individually the two downstream jobs, release and packaging.

- Re-triggering the release will do a version bump then push new artifacts.
- Re-triggering the packaging job won't published artifacts if they already exist but it will update website html.
====

=== Stable Release Candidate
A stable release-candidate is a manually triggered release that happens around once a month.
It uses parameters defined in this link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/stable-rc[file].

Before triggering a new stable release candidatae release, some steps are required:

. Prepare `jenkinsci/jenkins` repository -> missing documentation link.
. Create a branch on jenkins-infra/release with a branch name that match the release branch from jenkinsci/jenkins like `rc-stable-<jenkins_version>`.
. Review and update the stable environment https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/stable[file] with:
.. `RELEASE_GIT_BRANCH` set to the `jenkinsci/jenkins` release branch like `stable-2.235`
.. `PACKAGING_GIT_BRANCH` set to the appropriate `jenkinsci/packaging` branch, e.g. `stable-2.235`
. Trigger the stable link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/core%2Fstable%2Frelease/branches/[job]

[NOTE]
====
You can re-trigger individually the two downstream jobs, release and packaging.

- Re-triggering the release will do a version bump then push new artifacts.
- Re-triggering the packaging job won't published artifacts if they already exist but it will update website html.
====


=== Stable
A stable release is a manually triggered release that happens around once a month.
Refer to link:https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/[LTS Release Line] for more detailed information.
It uses parameters defined in this link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/stable[file].

Before triggering a new stable release, some steps are required:

. Prepare `jenkinsci/jenkins` repository -> missing documentation link.
. Create a branch on jenkins-infra/release with a branch name that match the release branch from jenkinsci/jenkins like `stable-<jenkins_version>`.
. Review and update the stable environment https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/stable[file] with:
.. `RELEASE_GIT_BRANCH` set to the `jenkinsci/jenkins` release branch like `stable-2.235`
.. `JENKINS_VERSION` set to the final release version that will be packaged. If set to 'stable' then the packaging job will try to guess the version based on what was pushed to the maven repository. cfr settings.
.. `PACKAGING_GIT_BRANCH` set to the appropriated `jenkinsci/packaging` branch
. Trigger the stable link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/core%2Fstable%2Frelease/branches/[job]

[NOTE]
====
You can re-trigger individually the two downstream jobs, release and packaging.

- Re-triggering the release will do a version bump then push new artifacts.
- Re-triggering the packaging job won't published artifacts if they already exist but it will update website html.
====

=== Security
The security release follows the same process as the stable one except that artifacts are published in private. So we need to promote git commits from a private repository to the public one then promote maven artifacts from a private maven repository to the public one.

The following sections assume you have prepared jenkinsci-cert/jenkins with security fixes and created a Maven staging repository as documented by the security team.

All steps need to be done twice: Once for weekly, once for LTS.

==== Preparation

. Create a (origin) branch on jenkins-infra/release with a branch name corresponding to the specific release, e.g. `security-2.287` or `security-stable-2.303.2`. Base them on the `master` (weekly) or `stable-2.303` (LTS) branch, respectively.
. In your fork, update the security environment https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/blob/master/profile.d/security[file] with the following (new) entries:
.. `RELEASE_GIT_BRANCH` set to the `jenkinsci-cert/jenkins` release branch like `security-stable-2.303`
.. `MAVEN_REPOSITORY_NAME` set to the maven repository name where we are going to publish staging maven artifacts, e.g. `caravelli`. This is also the source location used by the packaging job to build distribution packages.
.. `JENKINS_VERSION` set to the final release version that will be packaged.
.. `RELEASELINE` set to '-stable' for an LTS release, otherwise leave empty or undefined.
.. Open a PR from your fork's branch into the origin repository's branch to allow review.

==== Staging (before release day)

To stage the Maven artifacts, trigger the generic Release link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io/job/core/job/release/[job] from the appropriate branch like `security-stable-2.303.2`.

To do that, follow these steps:

.. Force repository scan
.. Trigger the first build to have access to job parameter and immediately abort it
.. Trigger a job with the correct parameters
... `RELEASE_PROFILE` set to `security`
... `RELEASE_GIT_BRANCH` set to `unused` as we already define it in the release profile file, which overrides the job parameter
... `MAVEN_REPOSITORY_NAME` set to `unused` as we already define it in the release profile file, which overrides the job parameter
... `VALIDATION_ENABLED` set to true if the validation stage should run

==== Publishing (on release day)

. To create and publish packages, trigger the generic Packaging job link:https://release.ci.jenkins.io/job/core/job/package/[job] from the appropriate branch like `security-stable-2.303.2` with correct parameters
.. `RELEASE_PROFILE` set to `security`
.. `RELEASE_GIT_BRANCH`  set to `unused` same reason as before
.. `MAVEN_REPOSITORY_NAME` set to `unused` same reason as before
.. `MAVEN_REPOSITORY_PRODUCTION_NAME` set to `unused`
.. `MAVEN_STAGING_REPOSITORY_PROMOTION_ENABLED` set to false (manually done by publishing-tool in a parallel process)
.. `GIT_STAGING_REPOSITORY_PROMOTION_ENABLED` set to false (manually merged by security team)
.. `VALIDATION_ENABLED` set to true

[NOTE]
====
You can re-trigger individually the two downstream jobs, release, and packaging.

- Re-triggering the release will do a version bump then push new artifacts.
- Re-triggering the packaging job won't publish artifacts if they already exist but it will update website html.

== Certificate

The Jenkins project uses a Digicert account provided by CDF to request code signing certificate.
The release environment is designed to download a pkcs12 certificate from Azure key vault.

. Get a code signing certificate from Digicert
. Convert the code signing certificate from Digicert to a pkcs12 certificate which also includes the private key
. Upload the pkcs12 certificate to Azure Key Vault
. Update the release environment credentials with appropriated password

.Certificate Fields

== Core Maintainers

More information about Jenkins Core maintainers and the different roles can be found in https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/docs/MAINTAINERS.adoc[MAINTAINERS].

== FAQ

**The stage release failed and we already push commits during the maven release.**

The problem here, is if we re-trigger the release job, we also update the release version again.
So if the process fails on running  `mvn release:stage`, then we can re-trigger it from inside the container as custom parameters are located in `settings-release.xml`.

```
kubectl get pods -n release # Looking for the correct jenkins agent name
kubectl exec -i -t -n release -c maven <pod_name alias jenkins agent> bash
cd /home/jenkins/agent/workspace/core_release_master/release
mvn -B -DstagingRepository=releases::https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases -s settings-release.xml --no-transfer-progress release:stage
